DEATH'S TRIALS
===

LORE:

It's Sunday night and, like every good Epitech student, you're spending your night at school to code half of your Wolf3D project in a few hours. But misfortune strikes and you slip on a banana peel while coding. Somehow, that sends you flying out the window (coding is dangerous!) and you die on impact with the ground.

Death comes to find you, and invites you to join in the afterlife. But you're not gonna take that - you have to turn in your project! So you challenge death to a race. Death smirks and suddenly, you're in a huge maze with high posts scattered across it. Death challenges you: You have to run across the maze so that you touch every post at least once, and you have to do it faster than Death itself!

Defeat death, and turn in your Wolf3D in time! Hurry!

EXERCISE:

Code a function runFast(), prototyped like this:

int        runFast(char **map);

map is a 2D map of characters that looks like this:

#######
#..@..#
#0..#B#
#######

#: wall
.: ground
0: Starting point
(any other symbol): post

You start from 0,
You must find the shortest path that crosses every other post in any order. That should be runFast()'s return value.

Tiles are accessed like this: map[y][x];

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

- You cannot go diagonally
- You cannot cross walls
- The order in which you cross the posts does NOT matter as long as you cross them all
- Your program should be properly optimized. Anything under one second is unacceptable,

This exercise might take a lot of code, I strongly advise you to use our correction main and test gradually.
