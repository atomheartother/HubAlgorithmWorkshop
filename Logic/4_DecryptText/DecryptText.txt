SUBJECT
==

Code a function 'CIAdecoder' prototyped like this:

void	CIAdecoder(char *text);

You must modify 'text' and decode it.

The experts found some information about the encryption scheme:
- [A-Z] and [a-z] characters are encoded, all the others aren't.
- The characters have been switched randomly.
- One character matches to only one other character.

Some experts are working on a dictionary method. For exemple, a two letter word can probably be French "le", "la", "il", "et", etc.. Some words are used more often than others. Some letters are used more often than others...

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

- May the force be with you.
