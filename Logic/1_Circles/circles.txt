Write a function interection which tells the user if two circles intsercet. It has this prototype :

bool intersection(int x1, int y1, int r1, int x2, int y2, int r2);

x1 && y1 are the center of the Circle1, and r1 is its radius.

this function will return 0 if the two circles intersect, and 1 if not.

						          __________________________
Just a friendly reminder : distance between two points = \/ (x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²

You can use the libmath to do the exercise.
